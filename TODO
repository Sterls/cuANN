TODO:
        1. Simple XOR with 1 thread works fine !!!
           Experiment with multiple threads

        2. Go through classes `trainer` and `trainer_data` there are a lot of TODO's.
           There are still memory allocations which we can avoid.

        3. Examine which kernels rely on previous values (theres only a few).
           The shared data across `trainer_data` should be zero'ed-filled for those calls.

        4. Create (de)serialisation for class ann: 
           Saving and Loading (Using BOOST) of a Trained network.

        5. Implement Resilient-Back-Propagation

        6. Examine and Experiment using other activation functors and their derivatives.
           Create a more examples, using well know training data-sets.
