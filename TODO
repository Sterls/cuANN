TODO:
        A. Fix, update, migrate and finish Multi-threaded Epochs 
           @see Projects/TESTS/boost_thread_reuse/

        B. Due to the templating of activation functions & derivatives
           we can now do `train` with template params: Activation Func, Activation Derivative Func.
           Same for propagate.
           Ideally, maybe they should be used either at construction time, or we could (not should)
           template the entire class?

        C. Create (de)serialisation for class ann: 
           Saving and Loading (Using BOOST) of a Trained network.

        D. Bias neurons: Although not nessesary, it would be nice to have them if needed?
