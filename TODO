TODO:
        A. Weight initialisations: +-sqrt(6)/sqrt(n) where n is number of nodes in previous layer + nodes in next layer
           https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.ai.neural-nets/vzWsObAi00I/cmf6o-RXBAAJ

        B. Fix, update, migrate and finish Multi-threaded Epochs 
           @see Projects/TESTS/boost_thread_reuse/

        C. Fix sigmoid as __device__ function
           Add a constant skew parameter (e.g., sigmoid(x) - 0.f)
        
        D. Training data needs to be shuffled randomly between Epochs. 
           Implement in Data class. VERY IMPORTANT!!!

        E. Examine templating any kind of activation function, so that we can swap activation methods easily.
           see the ai.comp.forum reply, user Ray mentions implementations.
           Implement TANH function: CUDA __tanhf()
                     SOFTSIGN function: https://brainlogging.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/these.pdf
                     RAMP function: ???

        F. Bias neurons: This is complex, I have to change all kernel functions and methods, leave this for last.

        G. Create (de)serialisation for class ann: 
           Saving and Loading (Using BOOST) of a Trained network.
